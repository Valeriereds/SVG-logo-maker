# SVG-logo-maker

## Description

This personalized SVG logo Generator was made in the hopes that any beginner business owner could use it as a jump start of making a quality logo for any of their projects. As a developer just starting out, I understand that when you're just starting out your business, making a personalized logo is the first thing you'll need to really make it stand out. This personalized logo Generator was not made without its trials and tribulations, one of them being how difficult the sizing for the logos were to test out. After a few trial and errors, I was able to correct the sizing, as well as use my shape testing to make example svg. The hardest part of this endeavor was figuring out how to import the generate shape functions correctly as well as writing them to file. The easiest and by far, neatest part was making the test for my shape functions and running it through the terminal. I hope you enjoy backend coding as much as I do and I hope that any business owner can use this generator to make a truly professional, personalized logo!

To use this personalized SVG logo Generator, simply open the index.js in the integrated terminal, run node index.js, and the user should be prompted with a series of questions on what they would like their logo's initials to be, what color they would like their text to be, what shape they would like their logo, and what color they would like their logo to be. When the user is finished, the personalized logo should be automatically generated, and be able to preview immediately, as shown in the attached screenshot.
